<p,h1,pbc>Reading Files in Java the Correct Way (Part 1)</>
Java offers multiple approaches to file reading, each with a direct impact on
application efficiency. Since reading files involves performing I/O operations,
selecting the appropriate method is crucial. Let’s discuss these methods and how
they compare in terms of performance.

As you walk through this article, I advise you to read the documentation of the
classes and methods as they are introduced. This article does not cover all
the methods and classes (obviously), nor all the intricacies of file reading.
However, it will prove useful for Java beginners/intermediate and those who haven’t
worked with I/O in java before.

<h2>1. Reading files correctly</h2>

From the machine perspective, a file is a sequence of bytes stored on disk. If the
file contains textual data, then each character in the file is encoded into one or
more bytes using some charset encoding. ASCII, UTF-8, and UTF-16 are examples of character
encodings. My machine uses UTF-8 by default. Reading text files one byte at a time (1 byte per disk IO)
may or may not be correct nor efficient, depending on the charset encoding. How about
an example. I have a file named <b>my_poem.txt</> with the following content:

The content of the file consist of ASCII characters. Each ASCII character is encoded with
a single bye. UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII, so we should get away with decoding
each byte separately.

To read the bytes, we can use an InputStream, a superclass of all classes representing an
input stream of bytes. Since we are reading a file, we are going to use the <ib>FileInputStream</>
implementation.

We instantiated a FileInputStream inside a try-with-resources block to handle the closing of
the stream automatically. Most I/O operations throw the checked IOException, thus we are obliged
to catch this exception or include it in the throws clause of the enclosing method.

<q2>The int read() method, reads the next byte from the input stream and returns -1 when
the stream is empty. In this example we are using a while loop to read every byte in the file,
one byte at a time, casting it to its corresponding ASCII character and printing it to the standard
output. Note that the value returned by read() is always ≤ 127 (the most significant bit is always
set to 0 so an ASCII character is effectively 7 bits allowing for 127 different characters).
The output of the above program matches exactly what’s in the file.</q2>

However, this program is vulnerable, and will fail to produce the correct output if the file
was updated to contain non-ASCII characters that spans multiple bytes. Actually let’s do just that:
I updated my_poem.txt to the following.

To correct the program, we should use a proper decoding mechanism. Fortunately, Java offers the
InputStreamReader, which reads from an InputStream and decodes the bytes according to the
specified charset encoding. The default encoding used by InputStreamReader class is the system’s
default charset. which is exactly what I need. Let’s see how <u>InputStreamReader</> works.
